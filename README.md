# Password Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates random passwords based on specified criteria. The generated password will meet the following criteria:
- Minimum length requirement
- Optional inclusion of numbers
- Optional inclusion of special characters

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.

### Running the Script

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

### Criteria Selection

1. You will be prompted to input the minimum length for the password. Enter a valid integer value.
2. You will then be asked whether you want to include numbers in the password. Type y for yes or n for no.
3. Similarly, you will be asked whether you want to include special characters in the password. Type y for yes or n for no.

### Generated Password

Once you've provided the required inputs, the script will generate a password that meets the specified criteria. The generated password will be displayed on the command line.

### Example

Here's an example of how the interaction with the script might look:

```bash
What's the minimum length?: 12
Do you want to have numbers (y/n)? y
Do you want to have special characters (y/n)? y
Generated Password: Ab4@Kc2!Dp5#
```
